This MATLAB package extracts MCSs from gridded IR images of INSAT3D satellite.
The tracking is based on the overlap techinique (Williams and Houze, 1987) where continuity of an MCS is decided according to the overlaps in two frames.

1. Use Grid_data.m for gridding raw data from INSAT3D satellite.
2. Run Track_CS.m for tracking of MCSs in the gridded dataset.
3. MCS are stored in .csv files in the 'MCSs_dataset' folder.

Note: The LAT-LON grid is set to (1/12) degree spatial resolution. The native INSAT-3D resolution is 4 km. Modify the spatial resolution of the grid as needed.

Tracking dataset columns:

ID,	Day,	Month,	Hour,	Minutes,	lat,	lon,	Area,	ImageNumber,	SplitParentID,	MergeParentID,	 MergeChldArea,	MinTemperature,	CoreArea,	AvgTemperature
